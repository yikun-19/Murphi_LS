Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./benchmarks/murphi_protocols/ldash_node4

Algorithm:
	Verification by our local search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 4232 bits (rounded up to 536 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  5242 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 9484231 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 948423 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

Result:

	Funny index value 4 for LockOwner[Home_1]: LAddress is internally represented from 6 to 6.
Internal Error in Type checking.

State Space Explored:

	0 states, 0 rules fired in 4.40s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
