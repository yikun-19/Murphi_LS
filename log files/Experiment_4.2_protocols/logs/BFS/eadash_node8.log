Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./benchmarks/murphi_protocols/eadash_node8

Algorithm:
	Verification by breadth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 54232 bits (rounded up to 6784 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  5242 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 770927 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 77092 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.
==========================================================================

You are using breath-first search algorithm:

==========================================================================

Result:

	Funny index value 4 for Procs[Home_1].Cache[Home_1]: Address is internally represented from 10 to 10.
Internal Error in Type checking.

State Space Explored:

	0 states, 0 rules fired in 1.12s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
