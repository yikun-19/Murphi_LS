Commands to use Murphi_LS:

1. Install dependencies & make:
  sudo make install
  sudo apt-get install flex 
  sudo apt-get install byacc
  
  cd src/
  make clean
  make

2. Run Murphi_LS to verify testcase_name.m located in test/  
  cd test/
  bash run.sh testcase_name
  
  Or if you want to set other options with Murphi_LS(e.g., -localsearch/-vbfs/vdfs), you can run these commands:
  ../src/mu testcase_name.m    # parser Murphi file to Cpp file
  g++ -ggdb -o testcase_name.o testcase_name.cpp -I ../include -lm  # compiler Cpp file to execute file(.o)
  ./testcase_name.o -localsearch -m 5000  # you can change options to what you what, run "./testcase_name.o -h" to show what options are supported in Murphi_LS

3. (version 1.4) Automatic imporvement of carelist by setting flows
  If the current careslists are not work very well, you can try setting flows for specific protocol to imporve the carelist. In Murphi_LS, you can modify the input flow using FlowSetter() in testcase_name.cpp.

  For example, test.cpp provides a flow in German protocol. Every number stands for a RuleBase with specific parameters, which can be found in testcase_name.cpp.
